    <h3>Interests:</h3>
    <p>Here I will go more in depth into my favotite interests and activites. Right now my favorite game is Genshin Impact. I say "right now" since as time goes on and I play more games or return to existing ones, my favorite game changes. However, my favorite game of all time has to be Spiderman for the PS4. I also enjoy reading. While not traditional novels or books I read mangas, manwhas, and comics. I also enjoy programming which is one of the main reasons I am enrolled in All Star Code. </p>

    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <p>I already stated a little about my academics but, I'm a rising senior at York Early College Academy and am also enrolled in two programs called SEO and All Star Code. At SEO I learn alot about the college process while building a personal statement and learning writing and math throughout the day. At All Star Code, we learn about programming using the languages javascript, HTML, and CSS. We also learn about building a resume and skills that will be useful to have. Overall I have a lot on my plate I feel but I am able to obtain a healthy school/life balance. </p>
